        <h2>Week 6: Individual Meetings &amp; Application Material Review</h2>
        <p><strong>Objectives:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Conduct individual meetings to review and refine application materials.</li>
            <li>Understand the importance of presenting a professional portfolio, a well-organized GitHub, and thoughtfully crafted resume and cover letter.</li>

        <h3>Job Application Rubric</h3>
        <p>The job application rubric is designed to help you understand the key components of effective application materials. Each component plays a crucial role in demonstrating your professionalism, skills, and readiness for the opportunities you are pursuing. Here are the areas we will focus on:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Professional Portfolio:</strong> Showcases your best projects, diverse skills, and creative solutions. It should reflect your ability to produce impactful work that aligns with industry standards.</li>
            <li><strong>Thoughtfully Designed GitHub:</strong> Demonstrates clean code practices, logical project structure, comprehensive commenting, and engaging documentation. Active participation in the community through open source contributions and regular updates is also essential.</li>
            <li><strong>Resume and Cover Letter:</strong> These documents should be tailored to each job application, highlighting relevant skills, experiences, and achievements. They must articulate your career objectives and how they align with the roles you are applying for, presenting a coherent narrative of your professional journey.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The importance of these materials cannot be overstated. They are your first opportunity to make a strong impression on potential employers. Well-prepared materials demonstrate your dedication, professionalism, and attention to detailâ€”qualities highly valued in the game development industry.</p>
